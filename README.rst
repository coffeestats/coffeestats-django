Coffeestats
===========

This is the Django_ port of coffeestats_. The port was started because of the
PHP uglyness.

.. _Django: https://www.djangoproject.com/
.. _coffeestats: https://github.com/coffeestats/coffeestats/

Coffeestats is the software running at https://coffeestats.org/. Coffeestats
allows registered users to track their caffeine usage (currently coffee and
mate). The site provides nice charts with aggregated data of the current user's
as well as other user's caffeine consumption.
